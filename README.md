WKRPT
=====

WKRPT is a LaTeX template for work term reports based on [TheKevJames/wkrpt][1]. It's meant for Software Engineering students at the University of Waterloo.

I have closely followed the [sample work report][2] found on the [Work term reports guidelines][3] page.

Usage
=====

I recommend using [ShareLaTeX][4]. Copy this project into your own account and then start editing:

If you'd rather use a local LaTeX installation, clone this repository and run `make`.
