WKRPT
=====

WKRPT is a LaTeX template for writing Waterloo Software Engineering work term reports. It is based on [TheKevJames/wkrpt][1]; see the notes for version 1.0 in [CHANGES](CHANGES) for details.

This template follows the format of the sample work report [Design Decisions for Implementing Backside Video in the SomeProduct][2] found on the [Work term reports guidelines][3] page.

Usage
=====

I recommend writing the work report using [ShareLaTeX][4]. Copy this read-only project into your own account and then start editing:

If you'd rather use a local LaTeX installation, clone this repository and run `make`.
